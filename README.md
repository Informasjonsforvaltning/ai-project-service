# AI Project Service

This application provides an API for retrieving AI projects that are supported by the norwegian government. It has a
simple CSV parser written in Go. It consists of several Go source code files that implement a system for reading data
from a CSV file and returning it as a two-dimensional slice of strings.

For a broader understanding of the systemâ€™s context, refer to
the [architecture documentation](https://github.com/Informasjonsforvaltning/architecture-documentation) wiki. For more
specific context on this application, see the **Portal** subsystem section.
